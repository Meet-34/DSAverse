C++ STL is divided mainly into 4 parts: 
->Algrithms 
->Containers
->Functions
->Iterators

How to print vector elements? 
->Directly using the name of vector. 
let name of vector is v.
v[0] (To print the value at index 0 in vector)

->Using Iterators. An iterator points to a memory address, not the element.
Ierator can point to various memory location: 
--> vectorName.begin()
--> vectorName.end() 
This doesn't point to the memory location of last element present in the vector instead it points to the memory address just after the last element. 
Therefore, in order to print the last element, we must first decrement the iterator by one position.
--> vectorName.rend()
--> vectorName.rbegin()
rend() and rbegin() are rarely used.
