C++ STL is divided mainly into 4 parts: 
->Algrithms 
->Containers
->Functions
->Iterators

How to print vector elements? 
->Directly using the name of vector. 
let name of vector is v.
v[0] (To print the value at index 0 in vector)

->Using Iterators. An iterator points to a memory address, not the element.
Ierator can point to various memory location: 
--> vectorName.begin()
--> vectorName.end() 
This doesn't point to the memory location of last element present in the vector instead it points to the memory address just after the last element. 
Therefore, in order to print the last element, we must first decrement the iterator by one position.
--> vectorName.rend()
--> vectorName.rbegin()
rend() and rbegin() are rarely used. 

Various functions used on vectors :- 
vectorName.insert(); -> It is very costly
vectorName.erase(); -> erases the element from the vector
vectorName.push_back(); -> adds the element into the vector
vectorName.emplace_back(); -> same as push_back but faster
vectorName.size(); -> gives the size of the vector 
vectorName.pop_back(); -> deletes the last element of the vector
vector1Name.swap(vector2Name); -> swaps both of the vectors
vectorName.clear(); -> erases the entire vector 
vectorName.empty(); -> prints 1(true) if the vector is empty otherwise 0(false)

In list, we can directly use the push_front function instead of insert(as discussed in vector).
List is a doubly linked list where vector is a singly linked list therefore, In terms of time complexity,
push_front function in list is actually very cheap when compared to insert function in vectors.
